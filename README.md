# Weighted A* Search with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Integration
This project implements an experiment framework combining the Weighted A* search algorithm with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. 
The main objective is to evaluate the performance of the A* search algorithm under different weight (w) values, 
and compare the results with a CNN-based approach that guides the search process.
